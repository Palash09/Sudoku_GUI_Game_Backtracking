# Sudoku_GUI_Game_Backtracking
I have built a GUI based Sudoku Game which uses backtracking algorithm for finding the correct solutions for each box.

The game uses backtracking algorithm to find the apropos value which should be placed in a box which is entered by the player. 
If the value is correct, it gets placed in the box. Otherwise, the user is informed that it is wrong by a red cross sign.

The GUI is built using pygame library. The screen also has a timer which records the amount of time used for finishing the game.

The output of sudoku game is shown below.

In this game, at the bottom right corner there is a timer which will keep a check of the time taken to finish the game. First,
a number can be entered in a box which is shown by grey number placed at the top left in the box. To check if the entered number 
is correct or not, the player can press **"enter" key**. If the number is correct, it will be placed in the box otherwise a cross
will be placed at bottom left.
