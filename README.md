# Sudoku_GUI_Game_Backtracking
I have built a GUI based Sudoku Game which uses backtracking algorithm for finding the correct solutions for each box.

The game uses backtracking algorithm to find the apropos value which should be placed in a box which is entered by the player. 
If the value is correct, it gets placed in the box. Otherwise, the user is informed that it is wrong by a red cross sign.

The GUI is built using pygame library. The screen also has a timer which records the amount of time used for finishing the game.
